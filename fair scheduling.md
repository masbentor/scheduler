# Complete Implementation Plan: Fair Scheduling with Holidays

## 1. Data Models and Storage
1. Create a `Holiday` model to store holiday dates for the year
   - Support batch upload of holiday dates
   - Include start and end dates to handle multi-day holidays
   - Store year-to-date historical holiday data

2. Add a fairness tracking system to store historical assignments
   - Track assignments by person, date, and day type
   - Maintain cumulative counts of regular days, weighted days, and total days
   - Support year-to-date historical data retention

3. Implement weights for different day types
   - Regular weekdays: Standard weight
   - Weekends: Higher weight
   - Holidays: Higher weight
   - Middle days of long weekends: Highest weight
   - Fridays: Tracked separately for special handling

## 2. Holiday Management
1. Add API endpoints to upload/manage holiday dates for the year
   - Support single holiday creation/deletion
   - Support bulk upload (CSV, JSON)
   - Include validation for date formats and duplicate detection

2. Implement detection of "long weekends" and middle days
   - Detect when holidays connect to weekends to form 3+ day breaks
   - Identify and flag middle days for special weighting
   - Calculate appropriate weights based on position in long weekend

3. Create a service to categorize days by type
   - Weekday (Mon-Thu)
   - Friday (special handling)
   - Weekend (Sat-Sun)
   - Holiday (any official holiday)
   - Special cases (middle of long weekend)

## 3. Fairness Calculation System
1. Implement a weighted scoring system for different day types
   - Assign appropriate weights to each day type
   - Calculate cumulative weighted scores for each person
   - Support dynamic weight adjustments if needed

2. Create historical tracking for each person's assignments
   - Store all assignments with date and day type
   - Calculate running totals of different day types
   - Track year-to-date statistics for long-term balancing

3. Build fairness metrics to evaluate distribution quality
   - Calculate standard deviation of assignments across staff
   - Track min/max/average values for different day types
   - Generate fairness indicators for monitoring

4. Implement comprehensive fairness balancing
   - Balance total days assigned in each period (short-term fairness)
   - Balance weighted days (weekends/holidays) over time (long-term fairness)
   - When uneven distributions are necessary, prioritize staff with fewer accumulated weighted days
   - Assign fewer Friday shifts to staff with higher weighted day counts
   - Continuously balance both regular and weighted days across all staff members

## 4. Enhanced Scheduling Algorithm
1. Modify the scheduling algorithm to consider:
   - Historical assignments (year-to-date)
   - Weekend/holiday distribution
   - Special handling for mid-long-weekend days
   - The soft rule for 2-day gaps between assignments (preferred spacing)

2. Implement tiered constraints:
   - Hard constraint: No consecutive days under any circumstances
   - Medium constraint: Min/max day requirements per person
   - Soft constraint: Fair distribution of weighted days
   - Soft constraint: Preferred 2-day gaps between assignments when possible

## 5. Reporting and Monitoring
1. Add metrics for tracking fairness over time
   - Total assignments per person
   - Weighted day distribution
   - Weekend/holiday distribution
   - Overall fairness scores

2. Implement warnings for uneven distributions
   - Alert when distribution exceeds threshold of unfairness
   - Highlight individuals with significantly higher/lower weighted assignments
   - Flag potential scheduling issues before they become problematic

3. Create statistics about holiday/weekend assignments
   - Summary reports by person, group, time period
   - Drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis
   - Visual indicators of fairness/unfairness

## 6. Integration with Existing System
1. Update the existing scheduler to use the enhanced algorithm
   - Maintain core functionality while adding fairness improvements
   - Ensure compatibility with existing API endpoints
   - Update scheduling logic to incorporate new constraints

2. Modify the historical data storage to maintain year-to-date records
   - Add storage for long-term assignment history
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Support querying of historical data for fairness calculations

3. Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality
   - Maintain support for current API contracts
   - Preserve existing behavior where appropriate
   - Add new features without breaking existing workflows

This comprehensive plan addresses all requirements for fair scheduling with special consideration for holidays, weekends, and the distribution of demanding shifts over time.
